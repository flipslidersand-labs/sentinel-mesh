# Changelog

All notable changes to SentinelMesh are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **go-collector:** `sentinel-collector token issue|revoke|list` subcommands and a
  per-agent token store in BadgerDB (#195, #198). gRPC auth resolves the agent
  identity (`node_id`) from the presented token (#196); see ADR-005 (#188).
- **Agent / deploy:** `--grpc-token` and `--grpc-ca-cert` (`SENTINEL_GRPC_CA_CERT`)
  for bearer-token auth and TLS verification against the collector, also accepted
  by `scripts/deploy-agent.sh` (#85). `deploy-agent.sh --grpc-token` is limited to
  a single host and requires `--node-id`, since a per-agent token is bound to one
  `node_id` (#200).
- **Web UI:** API Token widget; the bundled UI now sends the `Authorization`
  header (#144).
- gRPC auth-failure and rate-limit rejection metrics (#266).

### Changed

- **BREAKING (go-collector):** gRPC authentication is now controlled by the new
  `--grpc-auth=required|disabled` flag (default `required`) instead of being
  implicitly enabled by `SENTINEL_API_TOKEN` (#222). With `required` and no
  issued per-agent tokens the collector still starts but rejects every RPC.
  Migration: issue per-agent tokens (`sentinel-collector token issue <node_id>`)
  or pass `--grpc-auth=disabled` to keep the previous unauthenticated behaviour.
  `scripts/install-collector.sh` gained `--grpc-auth`.
- **BREAKING (go-collector):** REST API authentication is now controlled by the new
  `--http-auth=required|disabled` flag (default `required`), in both normal and
  `--aggregate` mode (#254). With `required` and `SENTINEL_API_TOKEN` unset the
  collector now exits at startup instead of serving the REST API unauthenticated
  with only a warning. Migration: set `SENTINEL_API_TOKEN` (and enter it in the
  bundled UI) or pass `--http-auth=disabled` to keep the previous unauthenticated
  behaviour. `scripts/install-collector.sh` gained `--http-auth`.
  `/metrics` is behind the same bearer auth as `/api/*` (only `/healthz` is open). The
  installer now fails (with the journal tail) if the unit is not active after start, and the
  README/`serve --help` examples were fixed so they start (#279).

### Security

- Per-agent bearer tokens for the gRPC channel instead of a shared token
  (#195, #196, #198, ADR-005 / #188); token lookup is O(1) so valid tokens are not
  throttled by the auth-failure limiter (#238).
- gRPC server TLS + bearer authentication (#85); failed-auth RPCs are rate
  limited (#230).
- gRPC server limits: `MaxConcurrentStreams`, `MaxRecvMsgSize`, keepalive
  enforcement and a per-stream `StreamEvents` rate limit; notification dispatch
  is bounded (#98).
- `Register` validates `node_id` / `hostname` / `ip` / `version` / `region`
  before persisting (#128).
- `deploy-agent.sh` / `install-collector.sh` validate inputs interpolated into
  systemd units (command-injection fix, #87) and validate ssh/scp hosts, rejecting
  option-like hosts (#88).
- The aggregator sends the bearer token when polling upstream collectors, so
  cross-region aggregation keeps working with REST auth enabled (#179).
- `/metrics` is gated behind bearer auth like `/api/*` (#180; see Changed, #279).
- `StreamEvents` validates `node_id` / `event_id` / payload strings (#166) and
  applies its rate limit before validation (#173); the limit is a shared bucket
  per authenticated `node_id` across streams (#277).
- The agent IP is derived from the gRPC peer, not a client-supplied field (#178).
- `deploy-agent.sh` no longer leaks the gRPC bearer token (#174); Slack send
  errors no longer include the webhook URL (#256).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-17

First tagged release. End-to-end eBPF-based host monitoring mesh, verified on
real hardware (YUKI WSL2 #57, DS1 WSL2 #59).

### Added

#### Agent (Rust)
- eBPF kernel programs loading real kernel events via `aya`
  (exec tracepoint, openat tracepoint, `tcp_connect` kprobe) with a mock mode
  fallback for testing.
- gRPC streaming client to the collector.
- `--region` flag / `SENTINEL_REGION` env for region tagging, sent on register.

#### Collector (Go)
- gRPC server + REST API ingesting kernel events into BadgerDB.
- Sliding-window anomaly detection.
- Heartbeat timeout — stale agents marked inactive (phase 4).
- Alerting engine with `rules.yaml` evaluation.
- Slack / Email alert notifications.
- Cross-region pull-based aggregation layer with `/api/regions` and region
  filtering on events.

#### Web UI (React)
- Dashboard with Nodes / Events / Alerts / Stats views.
- Event/alert filtering and time-range selection; node filter on `/api/events`.

#### Observability
- OpenTelemetry metrics and distributed traces.

#### Deployment
- Multi-node deploy scripts (`build.sh`, `deploy-agent.sh`) targeting
  MINIPC / YUKI / DS1 with real-eBPF mode, multi-host and region flags.
- `demo-multi-region.sh` demo.

### Verified
- Real eBPF load/attach confirmed on two hosts (YUKI, DS1), kernel 6.6.x WSL2,
  via `/proc/<pid>/fd` BPF prog/map/link inspection.
