## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-17

First tagged release. End-to-end eBPF-based host monitoring mesh, verified on
real hardware (YUKI WSL2 #57, DS1 WSL2 #59).

### Added

#### Agent (Rust)
- eBPF kernel programs loading real kernel events via `aya`
  (exec tracepoint, openat tracepoint, `tcp_connect` kprobe) with a mock mode
  fallback for testing.
- gRPC streaming client to the collector.
- `--region` flag / `SENTINEL_REGION` env for region tagging, sent on register.

#### Collector (Go)
- gRPC server + REST API ingesting kernel events into BadgerDB.
- Sliding-window anomaly detection.
- Heartbeat timeout — stale agents marked inactive (phase 4).
- Alerting engine with `rules.yaml` evaluation.
- Slack / Email alert notifications.
- Cross-region pull-based aggregation layer with `/api/regions` and region
  filtering on events.

#### Web UI (React)
- Dashboard with Nodes / Events / Alerts / Stats views.
- Event/alert filtering and time-range selection; node filter on `/api/events`.

#### Observability
- OpenTelemetry metrics and distributed traces.

#### Deployment
- Multi-node deploy scripts (`build.sh`, `deploy-agent.sh`) targeting
  MINIPC / YUKI / DS1 with real-eBPF mode, multi-host and region flags.
- `demo-multi-region.sh` demo.

### Verified
- Real eBPF load/attach confirmed on two hosts (YUKI, DS1), kernel 6.6.x WSL2,
  via `/proc/<pid>/fd` BPF prog/map/link inspection.
